First project from the odin project web dev course.

This is a webpage that will link to a few pages that will include recipes to a few dishes.

The course has been really great so far and i feel like i retain the information a lot more compared to other courses i have tried. 
I was struggling a bit with the git commands at the beginning but after looking up a few videos it became clear and i feel pretty confident with the basic commands now.
